Project Title: memai-sdk

Overview:
memai-sdk is a TypeScript SDK for the [mem.ai REST API](https://docs.mem.ai). It enables seamless integration with mem.ai, providing developers with a robust, type-safe, and ergonomic interface to interact with all available API endpoints.

Features:
- API Client
  - Creates a client using the API key
  - Functions to call all of the mem.ai API endpoints
  - Gracefully handles rate limit errors
- SDK Documentation
  - Searchable documentation
  - Chat with doc options for interactive help
- MCP Server
  - Provides instructions on how to use both the raw mem.ai REST API and the new TypeScript SDK

Technical Requirements:
- TypeScript
- pnpm for package management
- Integration with mem.ai REST API (Bearer token authentication)
- Documentation site (searchable, chat-enabled)
- MCP server for usage instructions

Constraints / Out of Scope:
- No client-side exposure of API keys
- Only server-side usage of the SDK and API
- No support for legacy mem.ai endpoints (only current documented endpoints)

Success Criteria:
- The SDK and MCP server are published to npmjs.com
- The documentation site is hosted on Vercel and is fully functional
- Users can search docs and interact with a chat assistant for help
- All mem.ai API endpoints are accessible and handled gracefully (including rate limits)
