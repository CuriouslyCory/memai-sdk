      "taskTitle": "Set up Documentation Site Framework",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the process of setting up the documentation site framework into specific steps including: 1) Evaluating and selecting the appropriate static site generator, 2) Setting up the initial project structure, 3) Configuring basic styling and navigation, and 4) Implementing the build process for TSDoc integration.",
      "reasoning": "Setting up a documentation framework requires technical decisions, configuration, and integration planning. The complexity comes from evaluating options, setting up the project structure, and ensuring it can accommodate future TSDoc integration."

      "taskTitle": "Integrate Search into Documentation Site",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the search integration task into: 1) Researching and selecting an appropriate search solution compatible with the chosen documentation framework, 2) Implementing and configuring the search indexing process, and 3) Developing the search UI components and results display.",
      "reasoning": "Search integration involves selecting a third-party service or library, configuring indexing for documentation content, and implementing UI components. The complexity stems from ensuring proper indexing of technical content and providing relevant search results."

      "taskTitle": "Integrate Chat Assistant into Documentation Site",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the chat assistant integration into: 1) Researching available chat assistant options and APIs, 2) Selecting and setting up the appropriate solution, 3) Training or configuring the assistant with SDK documentation content, 4) Implementing the chat UI components, and 5) Testing and refining the assistant's responses.",
      "reasoning": "Implementing a chat assistant is complex as it requires integration with AI services, potential training or fine-tuning on documentation content, and developing an interactive UI. Ensuring the assistant provides accurate and helpful responses adds significant complexity."

      "taskId": 14,
      "taskTitle": "Develop MCP Server Structure and Content",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the MCP server development into: 1) Designing the server architecture and API endpoints, 2) Implementing the server using Node.js/Express, 3) Creating comprehensive documentation content with code examples for both REST API and SDK usage, and 4) Setting up deployment configuration for the server.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves both server development and creating instructional content. The complexity comes from needing to understand both the raw API and SDK thoroughly to provide accurate guidance, plus implementing a functional server application."

      "taskTitle": "Prepare Docs Site for Deployment on Vercel",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Vercel deployment preparation into: 1) Configuring the documentation site for static export or Vercel-compatible build process, 2) Setting up environment variables and deployment configurations, and 3) Creating and testing deployment preview workflows.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves platform-specific configuration and ensuring the build process works correctly in the Vercel environment. The complexity is moderate as it requires understanding of both the documentation framework and Vercel's deployment requirements."

      "taskId": 17,
      "taskTitle": "Final Testing and Validation",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the final testing process into: 1) Creating a comprehensive test plan covering all components, 2) Testing the SDK with real API interactions, 3) Validating the documentation site functionality including navigation and search, 4) Testing the chat assistant with various query scenarios, and 5) Verifying the MCP server content and functionality.",
      "reasoning": "End-to-end testing across multiple components requires extensive test planning and execution. The complexity is high due to the need to test interactions between the SDK, documentation site, and MCP server, as well as validating against success criteria."
    },

      "taskId": 18,
      "taskTitle": "Publish SDK to npm",
      "complexityScore": 3,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 2,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the npm publishing process into: 1) Preparing the package for publication including final version checks and documentation updates, and 2) Executing the publication process and verifying availability.",
      "reasoning": "Publishing to npm is a relatively straightforward process with established steps. The complexity is low, mainly involving package preparation and following npm's publication workflow."

      "taskTitle": "Deploy Documentation Site to Vercel",
      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Vercel deployment process into: 1) Connecting the repository to Vercel and configuring project settings, 2) Setting up environment variables and deployment configurations, and 3) Executing and validating the production deployment.",
      "reasoning": "Deploying to Vercel involves standard steps for connecting a repository and configuring deployment settings. The complexity is moderate, requiring attention to environment variables and validation of the deployed site."
