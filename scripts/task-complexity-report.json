      "taskTitle": "Set up Documentation Site Framework",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the process of setting up the documentation site framework into specific steps including: 1) Evaluating and selecting the appropriate static site generator, 2) Setting up the initial project structure, 3) Configuring basic styling and navigation, and 4) Implementing the build process for documentation generation.",
      "reasoning": "Setting up a documentation framework involves technical decisions, configuration, and integration with the existing codebase. The complexity comes from selecting the right tool, configuring it properly, and ensuring it can handle TSDoc integration."

      "taskTitle": "Integrate Search into Documentation Site",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the search integration task into: 1) Researching and selecting an appropriate search solution compatible with the chosen documentation framework, 2) Implementing and configuring the search indexing process, and 3) Developing the search UI components and results display.",
      "reasoning": "Search integration involves selecting a third-party service or library, configuring indexing for documentation content, and implementing UI components. The complexity stems from ensuring proper indexing of technical content and providing relevant search results."

      "taskTitle": "Integrate Chat Assistant into Documentation Site",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the chat assistant integration into: 1) Evaluating chat assistant options and APIs, 2) Setting up the selected service/API integration, 3) Training or configuring the assistant with SDK documentation, 4) Developing the chat UI components, and 5) Implementing response handling and conversation management.",
      "reasoning": "Integrating a chat assistant is complex as it involves AI/ML components, API integration, and potentially training a model on documentation content. The UI must be intuitive, and the assistant needs to provide accurate, contextual responses about technical SDK details."

      "taskId": 14,
      "taskTitle": "Develop MCP Server Structure and Content",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the MCP server development into: 1) Designing the server architecture and API endpoints, 2) Implementing the server application with Express.js, 3) Creating comprehensive usage documentation with code examples for both REST API and SDK, and 4) Setting up deployment configuration for the server.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires building a server application and creating detailed technical content. The complexity comes from ensuring the server properly demonstrates both raw API and SDK usage with accurate examples and clear instructions."

      "taskTitle": "Prepare SDK for npm Publication",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the npm publication preparation into: 1) Configuring package.json with all required metadata and dependencies, 2) Setting up build scripts and ensuring proper output file structure, and 3) Creating comprehensive README and documentation files for the package.",
      "reasoning": "While technically straightforward for experienced developers, this task requires attention to detail in package configuration, build process setup, and documentation. The complexity is moderate as it involves ensuring the package is properly structured for public consumption."

      "taskTitle": "Prepare Docs Site for Deployment on Vercel",
      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Vercel deployment preparation into: 1) Configuring build settings and environment variables for the documentation site, 2) Setting up proper routing and configuration in vercel.json, and 3) Creating deployment scripts and testing the deployment process.",
      "reasoning": "Deploying to Vercel is relatively straightforward with modern frameworks, but requires proper configuration of build processes, environment variables, and potentially custom routing. The complexity is moderate as it involves ensuring the site builds correctly in a production environment."

      "taskId": 17,
      "taskTitle": "Final Testing and Validation",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the final testing process into: 1) Creating a comprehensive test plan covering all components, 2) Testing SDK functionality with real API endpoints, 3) Validating documentation site features including search and chat, 4) Testing MCP server functionality and content accuracy, and 5) Performing cross-browser and mobile compatibility testing.",
      "reasoning": "Final testing is complex as it requires comprehensive validation of multiple interconnected components. The task involves creating test plans, executing tests across different environments, and ensuring all components work together seamlessly."

      "taskTitle": "Publish SDK to npm",
      "complexityScore": 3,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 2,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the npm publication process into: 1) Preparing the final package version and performing pre-publication checks, and 2) Executing the publication process and verifying the package is correctly available on npm.",
      "reasoning": "Publishing to npm is a relatively straightforward process once the package is properly prepared. The complexity is low, mainly involving account authentication, version management, and verification of the published package."
