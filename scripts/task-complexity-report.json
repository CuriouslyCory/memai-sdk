      "taskTitle": "Develop MCP Server Structure and Content",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the MCP server development task into subtasks covering: 1) Server setup with Node.js/Express, 2) API documentation structure design, 3) Raw API usage examples creation, 4) SDK usage examples implementation, and 5) Testing and validation of the documentation.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves both backend development and documentation creation. It requires setting up a server, organizing content structure, and creating comprehensive examples for both raw API and SDK usage. The dependencies on multiple previous tasks also increase complexity."

      "taskTitle": "Prepare Docs Site for Deployment on Vercel",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the Vercel deployment preparation into subtasks: 1) Configure static export or build process compatibility, 2) Set up environment variables and security configurations, and 3) Create and test vercel.json configuration file.",
      "reasoning": "This task has moderate complexity as it involves configuration for deployment rather than development. It requires understanding of Vercel's deployment process, environment variable handling, and potential build optimizations, but is more straightforward than development tasks."

      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the final testing and validation into subtasks: 1) Create comprehensive test plan and checklist, 2) Test SDK core functionality with real API key, 3) Test error handling and edge cases, 4) Validate documentation site navigation and search, 5) Test chat assistant functionality, and 6) Verify MCP server content accuracy.",
      "reasoning": "This is a high-complexity task as it requires thorough testing of all components of the project. It depends on multiple previous tasks being completed and involves validating different systems working together. Comprehensive testing requires attention to detail and systematic approach."

      "complexityScore": 3,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 2,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the npm publishing process into subtasks: 1) Prepare package for publication (final version check, README verification, package.json validation), and 2) Execute publication process and verify availability.",
      "reasoning": "This is a relatively straightforward task with established procedures. The main complexity comes from ensuring the package is correctly configured before publishing, but the actual publication process follows standard npm procedures."

      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Vercel deployment into subtasks: 1) Connect repository to Vercel and configure project settings, 2) Set up environment variables and deployment configurations, and 3) Execute production deployment and perform post-deployment validation.",
      "reasoning": "This task is moderately complex as it involves configuring a deployment pipeline and ensuring all components of the documentation site work correctly in production. The actual deployment process is streamlined with Vercel, but proper configuration and validation are still required."
